When to use BufferedReader and Scanner

Parsing Input
	Buffered Reader does not parse the input, it means it takes whatever the input user entered.
	It does not bother whether it is an integer or float or string.
	We need to explicitly convert according to desired output.
	It only uses br.readLine();
	
	While in case of Scanner Class, it takes different input according data type.
	Like for integer, it uses sc.nextInt(),
	For Float, it uses sc.nextFloat(),
	For String, it uses sc.nextLine(). 
	
Thread Safe
	While multithreading programming, always use Buffered Reader Class
	
Buffer Size
	Buffer size in Buffered Reader class is 8 KB and in Scanner class is 1 KB.
	So if we need huge or large input, we need to use Buffered Reader class
	
Speed
	Speed of Buffered Reader is better because it does not waste time performing parsing like Scanner.
	
Other 
	We can separate two integers while inputting using space.
	Space act as a delimiter in Scanner Class.
	We can change delimiter by useing sc.usedelimiter('*');	now '*' is delimiter.
